abstract = {The present study examined whether the ventilatory thresholds during an incremental exhaustive running test could be determined using heart rate variability (HRV) analysis. Beat-to-beat RR interval, V(.-)O (2), V(.-)CO (2) and V(.-) (E) of twelve professional soccer players were collected during an incremental test performed on a track until exhaustion. The "smoothed pseudo Wigner-Ville distribution" (SPWVD) time-frequency analysis method was applied to the RR time series to compute the usual HRV components vs. running speed stages. The ventilatory equivalent method was used to assess the ventilatory thresholds (VT1 and VT2) from respiratory components. In addition, ventilatory thresholds were assessed from the instantaneous components of respiratory sinus arrhythmia (RSA) by two different methods: 1) from the high frequency peak of HRV ( FHF), and 2) from the product of the spectral power contained within the high frequency band (0.15 Hz to fmax) by FHF (HF x FHF) giving two thresholds: HFT1 and HFT2. Since the relationship between FHF and running speed was linear for all subjects, the VTs could not be determined from FHF. No significant differences were found between respective running speeds at VT1 vs. HFT1 (9.83 +/- 1.12 vs. 10.08 +/- 1.29 km x h (-1), n.s.) nor between the respective running speeds at VT2 vs. HFT2 (12.55 +/- 1.31 vs. 12.58 +/- 1.33 km x h (-1), n.s.). Linear regression analysis showed a strong correlation between VT1 vs. HFT1 (R (2) = 0.94, p < 0.001) and VT2 vs. HFT2 (R (2) = 0.96, p < 0.001). The Bland-Altman plot analysis reveals that the assessment from RSA gives an accurate estimation of the VTs, with HF x FHF providing a reliable index for the ventilatory thresholds detection. This study has shown that VTs could be assessed during an incremental running test performed on a track using a simple beat-to-beat heart rate monitor, which is less expensive and complex than the classical respiratory measurement devices.},

abstract = {Expert performance is commonly accompanied by a subjective state of optimal experience called flow. Previous research has shown positive correlations between flow and quality of performance and suggests that flow may function as a reward signal that promotes practice. Here, piano playing was used as a flow-inducing behavior in order to analyze the relationship between subjective flow reports and psychophysiological measures. Professional classical pianists were asked to play a musical piece and then rate state flow. The performance was repeated five times in order to induce a variation in flow, keeping other factors constant, while recording the arterial pulse pressure waveform, respiration, head movements, and activity from the corrugator supercilii and zygomaticus major facial muscles. A significant relation was found between flow and heart period, blood pressure, heart rate variability, activity of the zygomaticus major muscle, and respiratory depth. These findings are discussed in relation to current models of emotion, attention, and expertise, and flow is proposed to be a state of effortless attention, which arises through an interaction between positive affect and high attention.},

abstract = {Flow is an optimal experience characterized by the perception of high challenges and high skills, positive affect, complete absorption in the activity carried out and intrinsic motivation. Although much research has examined the psychological features of flow, little is known about its biological underpinnings. The present study aimed at contributing to this gap by investigating the psychophysiological correlates of flow experience during daily routines. To this end, 15 university students took part in an experience sampling study, in which they provided real-time information on daily activities and associated experience while cardiac activity was monitored. After seven days of observation, 32 flow events were identified among 10 participants. A multilevel regression analysis revealed a significant correlation between optimal experience and specific cardiovascular indexes. In particular, the experience of flow was associated with increased heart rate and increased LF/HF ratio, suggesting relative sympathetic enhancement. These findings are in line with those obtained by previous related studies and indicate the feasibility of investigating physiological correlates of subjective experience in ecological contexts.},

Smoothness was quantified by evaluating the endpoint jerk-cost (JC) at the heel. Subjects walked at a speed of 1.75 m.s(-1) and ran at a speed of 3.35 m.s(-1) on a motor driven treadmill while 2-D kinematic data (60 Hz) were collected from a sagittal plane view. The runners were found to be smoother than the non-runners during both gait conditions, suggesting that this group was inherently smoother in gait related tasks. This study demonstrated that the smoothness of gait can be quantified objectively by evaluating the end-point JC at the heel, and that competitive runners tend to exhibit smoother strides than recreational runners during both running and fast walking.},

abstract = {Many activities can create flow. In his in-depth analysis Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi has found a number of factors common to activities creating flow, one being that a person's abilities optimally align with the challenges set by the task. This combined with other factors enables individuals to be so deeply absorbed in an activity that they do not only blend out their environment and their self but also lose all sense of time. There exist various methods to measure flow. The downside of existing procedures is, however, that they require an extensive range of equipment. Another disadvantage is that interviewing test subjects about their flow experience during the experiment naturally interrupts their flow.Within the framework of this research project a learning programme has been developed that allows its user to be in flow. While the user is in flow, a newly developed measurement method will record EEG signals that permit conclusions on the flow state without actually drawing the test subject out of it. This will then allow to empirically establish a causal link between flow and success in learning.},

Departing from correlational research, we applied experimental paradigms designed to test the impact of a skills-demands-compatibility on the emergence of flow in computerized tasks. On the one hand, the results from self-reports support the balance hypothesis and indicate that skills-demands-compatibility results in a pleasurable flow experience. On the other hand, the results also indicate that skills-demands-compatibility resulted in (a) reduced heart rate variability indicating enhanced mental workload, and (b) stress as indicated by relatively high levels of salivary cortisol. These results indicate that flow experiences combine subjectively positive elements with physiological elements reflecting strainful tension and mental load.},

abstract = {A major goal of motor coordination is the production of a smooth movement. Jerk-cost, which is an inverse measure of movement smoothness, has been evaluated during gum chewing in previous studies. However, the effect of the gum bolus is still unclear. The aims of this study were to compare the jerk-cost values of normal gum chewing with those of empty chewing. Thirteen subjects undertook, empty chewing, then chewing of gum, and then a second empty chewing. Jerk-cost was calculated from an accelerometer attached to the skin of the mentum. There was a significantly higher smoothness (i.e. lower jerk-cost, P < 0.05) during the opening and second-half closing phases in empty chewing compared with gum chewing. There were no significant differences in jerk-costs (i.e. opening or closing) between the first and the second empty-chewing sequences. These results suggest that the influence of the mechanical effects of tooth contact on jerk-cost is not restricted just to the occlusal phase of chewing, but rather the effect influences the entire opening and closing phases of chewing.},

A thorough review of short-term HRV data published since 1996 was therefore performed. Data from studies published after the 1996 Task Force report (i.e., between January 1997 and September 2008) and reporting short-term measures of HRV obtained in normally healthy individuals were collated and factors underlying discrepant values were identified. Forty-four studies met the pre-set inclusion criteria involving 21,438 participants. Values for short-term HRV measures from the literature were lower than Task Force norms. A degree of homogeneity for common measures of HRV in healthy adults was shown across studies. A number of studies demonstrate large interindividual variations (up to 260,000\%), particularly for spectral measures. A number of methodological discrepancies underlined disparate values. These include a systematic failure within the literature (a) to recognize the importance of RR data recognition/editing procedures and (b) to question disparate HRV values observed in normally healthy individuals. A need for large-scale population studies and a review of the Task Force recommendations for short-term HRV that covers the full-age spectrum were identified. Data presented should be used to quantify reference ranges for short-term measures of HRV in healthy adult populations but should be undertaken with reference to methodological factors underlying disparate values. Recommendations for the measurement of HRV require updating to include current technologies.},

abstract = {In this study, we investigate the relationship between stress and flow-experience with the help of psychophysiological arousal indicators. Whereas recent studies suggest a positive relation between flow and physiological arousal, so far nothing is known on the relation between flow and high arousal in response to a salient stressor. We here suggest that the relation of flow with sympathetic arousal and hypothalamic–pituitary–adrenal (HPA) axis activation follows an inverted u-curve rather than a linear function: moderate physiological arousal should facilitate flow-experience, whereas excessive physiological arousal should hinder flow. In order to experimentally stimulate high physiological arousal, we exposed 22 healthy male participants to a modified version of the Trier Social Stress Test. Then, participants had to perform a complex computer task for 60minutes and to rate their flow-experience on the Flow Short-Scale directly after task completion. During the experiment, cortisol samples were taken every 15minutes, and heart rate variability measures were assessed by continuous electrocardiography. We found an inverted u-shaped relationship of flow-experience with indices of sympathetic arousal and cortisol, whereas parasympathetic indices of heart rate control during stress were linearly and positively correlated with flow-experience. Our results suggest that moderate sympathetic arousal and HPA-axis activation and possibly a co-activation of both branches of the autonomic nervous system characterize task-related flow-experience.},

abstract = {PURPOSE: To investigate the effects of strenuous exercise on heart rate variability (HRV). METHODS: We evaluated the effects of exercise intensity and duration on HRV indices in 14 healthy trained subjects. Each subject exercised for 3, 6, and 9 min at 60 and 70\% of the power achieved at maximal oxygen consumption (PVO2(max)) and for 3 and 6 min (or 3 min twice) at 80\% of PVO2(max). The electrocardiogram RR intervals were recorded then processed by fast(FFT) and short-time (STFT) Fourier transform for determination of low-frequency (LF, 0.045-0.15 Hz) and high-frequency (HF, 0.15-1.0 Hz) components. RESULTS: The LF and HF components expressed as absolute power (ms2) decreased significantly at the onset of exercise (P < 0.05). However, with increasing exercise intensity, the HF component expressed as normalized units (n.u.) (reflecting parasympathetic modulation) increased significantly, whereas the LF component (n.u.) and LF/HF ratio (both reflecting sympathetic modulation) decreased significantly (P < 0.05). STFT showed that increasing exercise intensity was associated with a shift in HF peak frequency related to an increase in respiratory rate and a marked decrease in LF power (ms2). Moreover, HFn.u. rose (r = 0.918, P < 0.01) and LFms2 fell as minute ventilation increased (r = 0.906, P < 0.01). CONCLUSIONS: Parasympathetic respiratory control and nonautonomic mechanisms may influence the HF-peak shift during strenuous exercise. HRV and the usual indexes of sympathetic activity do not accurately reflect changes in autonomic modulation during exhaustive exercise.},

abstract = {Heart rate variability is a recognized parameter for assessing autonomous nervous system activity. Fourier transform, the most commonly used method to analyze variability, does not offer an easy assessment of its dynamics because of limitations inherent in its stationary hypothesis. Conversely, wavelet transform allows analysis of nonstationary signals. We compared the respective yields of Fourier and wavelet transforms in analyzing heart rate variability during dynamic changes in autonomous nervous system balance induced by atropine and propranolol. Fourier and wavelet transforms were applied to sequences of heart rate intervals in six subjects receiving increasing doses of atropine and propranolol. At the lowest doses of atropine administered, heart rate variability increased, followed by a progressive decrease with higher doses. With the first dose of propranolol, there was a significant increase in heart rate variability, which progressively disappeared after the last dose. Wavelet transform gave significantly better quantitative analysis of heart rate variability than did Fourier transform during autonomous nervous system adaptations induced by both agents and provided novel temporally localized information.},

abstract = {Zusammenfassung. Sportliche Aktivitäten wurden von Anbeginn in die Flow-Forschung einbezogen, wobei recht bald deutlich wurde, dass eine verlaufsnahe Diagnostik, also einer Diagnostik während der sportlichen Tätigkeit, dem Flow- Konstrukt am Besten entspricht. Allerdings liefern Feldstudien, welche die Auslösebedingungen für das Auftreten von Flow und die Flow-Leistungsbeziehung bei sportlichen Aktivitäten zu klären versuchen, eher inkonsistente Befunde. Ziel der vorliegenden Laufbandstudie war es daher: 1) zu prüfen, ob die von Csikszentmihalyi (1975) postulierte Anforderungs- Fähigkeits-Passung für Läufer auch unter Laborbedingungen Voraussetzung für das Auftreten von Flow ist und 2) die Dynamik des Flow-Erlebens im Zeitverlauf und in Abhängigkeit physiologischer Leistungsparameter beim Laufen zu doku- mentieren. Mit Hilfe einer beanspruchungsorientierten Geschwindigkeitssteuerung des Laufbands gelang es, die Probanden (N = 30) auf einem individuell bestimmten, überdurchschnittlichem Anspruchsniveau kontrolliert 40 Minuten laufen zu lassen. Im Fazit lässt sich feststellen, dass die Probanden über ein tiefes und im Verlauf stabiles Flow-Erleben berichten. Allerdings ist dies davon unabhängig, ob sie subjektiv eine optimale Anforderungs-Fähigkeits-Passung erleben. Schlüsselwörter: Selbstkonkordanz, Flow-Erleben, Ausdauersport, Beanspruchung, Laufbandstudie},

abstract = {The study presents a technique how to manipulate flow-experience via the computer game Roboguard. Under experimentally controlled conditions all parameters of the game and the situation were kept constant except the difficulty level the participants had to play on. Flow was assessed with the Flow Short Scale (FKS, Rheinberg et al., 2002). As predicted we received the highest Flow score on the medium/optimal level in comparison with an easy and difficult level (d > 1.0). We could not confirm the predicted negative effect of approval seeking goals (AGT, Hayamizu \& Weiner, 1991) on Flow experience. Instead all three AGT subscales correlated positively with the FKS-subscale absorption. Perhaps qualitative differences in initial motivation loose their influence if participants experience Flow under optimal conditions.},

This package, called RHRV, is a third party extension for the open source statistical environment R, and can be freely downloaded from the R-CRAN repository. We review the state of the art of software related to the analysis of heart rate variability (HRV). Based upon this review, we motivate the development of an open source software platform which can be used for developing new algorithms for studying HRV or for performing clinical experiments. In particular, we show how the RHRV package greatly simplifies and accelerates the work of the computer scientist or medical specialist in the HRV field. We illustrate the utility of our package with practical examples.},

abstract = {The aim of this paper is to describe and analyse the behaviour of heart rate variability (HRV) during constant-load, high-intensity exercise using a time frequency analysis (Wavelet Transform). Eleven elite cyclists took part in the study (age: 18.6±3.0 years; VO2max:4.88±0.61 litres·min−1). Ini- tially, all subjects performed an incremental cycloergometer test to determine load power in a constant load-test (379.55±36.02 W; 89.0\%). HRV declined dramatically from the start of testing (p<0.05). The behaviour of power spectral density within the LF band mirrored that of total energy, recording a significant decrease from the outset LF peaks fell rapidly thereafter, remaining stable until the end of the test. HF-VHF fell sharply in the first 20 to 30 seconds. The relative weighting (\%) of HF-VHF was inverted with the onset of fatigue, [1.6\% at the start, 7.1 (p<0.05) at the end of the first phase, and 43.1\% (p<0.05) at the end of the test]. HF-VHFpeak displayed three phases: a moderate initial increase, followed by a slight fall, thereafter increasing to the end of the test. The LF/HF-VHF ratio increased at the start, later falling progressively until the end of the first phase and remaining around minimal},

@article{Schuler2009,
abstract = {Objectives: This research aimed to shed light on the relationship between flow experience and perfor- mance in sports using a marathon race as an example. We hypothesized that flow influences the marathon race performance by an indirect rewarding effect. We assumed that the positive quality of flow experience rewards the pre-race running activity and thereby enhances training behavior which again leads to high race performance. A methodological issue of the this was to compare the retrospective with the experience-sampling measure of flow. Design: Three studies with marathon runners (Ns 1⁄4 109, 112, 65 for Studies 1, 2, and 3, respectively) were conducted. Method: They measured flow experience four times during a marathon race either retrospectively (Studies 1 and 2) or using an experience-sampling method during the race (Study 3). Additionally race performance and future running motivation (Studies 1, 2, and 3), pre-race training behavior (Studies 2 and 3) and flow experience in training (Study 3) were measured. Results: The results confirmed the hypothesis showing that flow during a marathon race is related to future running motivation, but is not directly linked to race performance. Instead, race performance was predicted by pre-race training behavior (Studies 2 and 3) which again was fostered by flow during the training (Study 3). The descriptive flow courses of the retrospective and the experience-sampling flow measures were comparable but also showed important differences. Conclusions: We critically discuss the practical implications of the rewarding effect of flow on perfor- mance and the advantages of the retrospective and experience-sampling measure of flow.},

abstract = {Kubios HRV is an advanced and easy to use software for heart rate variability (HRV) analysis. The software supports several input data formats for electrocardiogram (ECG) data and beat-to-beat RR interval data. It includes an adaptive QRS detection algorithm and tools for artifact correction, trend removal and analysis sample selection. The software computes all the commonly used time-domain and frequency-domain HRV parameters and several nonlinear parameters. There are several adjustable analysis settings through which the analysis methods can be optimized for different data. The ECG derived respiratory frequency is also computed, which is important for reliable interpretation of the analysis results. The analysis results can be saved as an ASCII text file (easy to import into MS Excel or SPSS), Matlab MAT-file, or as a PDF report. The software is easy to use through its compact graphical user interface. The software is available free of charge for Windows and Linux operating systems at http://kubios.uef.fi.},

abstract = {The first aim of this study was to compare an ambulatory five-lead ECG system with the commercially available breast belt measuring devices; Polar S810i and Suunto t6, in terms of R-R interval measures and heart rate variability (HRV) indices. The second aim was to compare different HRV spectral analysis methods. Nineteen young males (aged between 22 and 31 years, median 24 years) underwent simultaneous R-R interval recordings with the three instruments during supine and sitting rest, moderate dynamic, and moderate to vigorous static exercise of the upper and lower limb. For each subject, 17 R-R interval series of 3-min length were extracted from the whole recordings and then analyzed in frequency domain using (1) a fast Fourier transform (FFT), (2) an autoregressive model (AR), (3) a Welch periodogram (WP) and (4) a continuous wavelet transform (CWT). Intra-class correlation coefficients (ICC) and Bland-Altman limits of agreement (LoA) method served as criteria for measurement agreement. Regarding the R-R interval recordings, ICC (lower ICC 95\% confidence interval >0.99) as well as LoA (maximum LoA: -15.1 to 14.3 ms for ECG vs. Polar) showed an excellent agreement between all devices. Therefore, the three instruments may be used interchangeably in recording and interpolation of R-R intervals. ICCs for HRV frequency parameters were also high, but in most cases LoA analysis revealed unacceptable discrepancies between the instruments. The agreement among the different frequency transform methods can be taken for granted when analyzing the normalized power in low and high frequency ranges; however, not when analyzing the absolute values.},
